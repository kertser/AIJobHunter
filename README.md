## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — fast Python package manager
- **OpenAI API key** — for scoring, profile generation, form filling, and market extraction (not needed for mock/offline testing)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kertser/AIJobHunter.git
cd AIJobHunter
uv sync          # installs all dependencies including dev tools
```

> **Windows note:** All `uv` and `pytest` commands work the same in PowerShell. For `.env` creation, use `Copy-Item .env.example .env` instead of `cp`.

Verify the installation:

```bash
uv run hunt --help
uv run pytest -q          # 377 tests, all offline
```

---

## Getting Started — Step by Step

This is the recommended sequence to go from zero to a fully operational system.

### Step 1: Install & Configure

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Create your .env file
cp .env.example .env          # Linux/macOS
# Copy-Item .env.example .env  # Windows PowerShell
```

Edit `.env` and set your OpenAI API key:

```
JOBHUNTER_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

Initialise the database:

```bash
uv run hunt init
```

This creates `data/job_hunter.db` and the `data/reports/` directory.

### Step 2: Generate Your Profile

The system needs to understand your background. Provide your resume (PDF) and optionally your LinkedIn profile:

```bash
# Resume + LinkedIn URL (Playwright scrapes the public profile)
uv run hunt profile --resume path/to/resume.pdf --linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-name/

# Resume + LinkedIn PDF export (if you've downloaded it)
uv run hunt profile --resume path/to/resume.pdf --linkedin linkedin.pdf

# Resume only
uv run hunt profile --resume path/to/resume.pdf
```

**Or use the web GUI:** start the server (`uv run hunt --real --dry-run serve`) and go to **http://localhost:8000** — the Setup page will guide you.

This generates two files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/user_profile.yml` | Your extracted profile: name, skills, experience, desired roles, education |
| `data/profiles.yml` | Search profiles: keywords, location, seniority, scoring thresholds |

Verify what was generated:

```bash
uv run hunt profile --show
```

You can edit both files manually or via the **Profiles** page in the web GUI.

### Step 3: Log in to LinkedIn

The system uses browser cookies for authentication (no password storage):

```bash
uv run hunt login
```

A browser window opens. Log in to LinkedIn manually. Once login is detected, the browser closes and cookies are saved to `data/cookies.json`.

> **Note:** Cookies expire periodically. If discovery stops working, run `hunt login` again.

### Step 4: Test with a Dry Run

Before applying to real jobs, test the full pipeline in dry-run mode:

```bash
# Discover + score + "apply" without submitting
uv run hunt --real --dry-run run --profile default
```

This will:
1. **Discover** — search LinkedIn for jobs matching your profile keywords
2. **Score** — compute embedding similarity + LLM fit score for each job
3. **Queue** — mark qualifying jobs for application
4. **Apply (dry-run)** — walk through Easy Apply forms but stop before submitting
5. **Report** — generate a daily summary in `data/reports/`

Check the results:

```bash
# View the dashboard
uv run hunt --real --dry-run serve
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 5: Run for Real

Once you're satisfied with the scoring and job selection:

```bash
# Full pipeline — will submit applications
uv run hunt --real run --profile default
```

Or use the web GUI:

```bash
uv run hunt --real serve
# Open http://localhost:8000 → Pipeline page → click "Run Pipeline"
```

### Step 6: Market Intelligence (Optional)

After discovering and scoring some jobs, run market analysis to understand technology trends and how your skills compare to market demand:

**Via the web GUI** (easiest):

```bash
uv run hunt --real serve
# Open http://localhost:8000 → Pipeline page → click "Analyse Market"
```

**Via CLI:**

```bash
# Full market pipeline (7 steps)
uv run hunt --real market run-all --extractor openai --normalizer openai --profile default
```

This runs: Ingest → Extract → Graph → Trends → Role Model → Candidate Model → Match.

View results:
- **Web:** http://localhost:8000/market — trends, role archetypes, skill gaps, company demand
- **CLI:** `uv run hunt market report` — generates a market intelligence report in `data/reports/`
- **Job details:** each job now shows market-enhanced scoring data

---

## Web GUI

Start the web server:

```bash
uv run hunt --real --dry-run serve          # safe mode — won't submit applications
uv run hunt --real serve                    # live mode — will submit applications
uv run hunt --mock serve                    # offline testing with mock data
uv run hunt serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000  # custom bind address
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

### Pages

| Page | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | `/` | Visual stats — donut chart, fit histogram, skill gap bars, activity timeline, market intelligence panel |
| **Jobs** | `/jobs` | Sortable/filterable table with bulk actions, status management, persistent sort |
| **Job Detail** | `/api/jobs/{hash}` | Full description, scores, market boost, Easy Apply button, application history |
| **Pipeline** | `/run` | Trigger Discover / Score / Apply / Full Pipeline / Market Analysis with live SSE progress |
| **Market** | `/market` | Technology trends, rising entities, role archetypes, candidate matches, company demand |
| **Profiles** | `/profiles` | Edit user profile and search profiles (skills, keywords, thresholds) |
| **Resume Review** | `/resume-review` | AI gap analysis — missing skills, improvement suggestions, quick wins |
| **Reports** | `/reports` | Browse and view daily pipeline + market reports |
| **Account** | `/account` | Personal account settings — edit display name, email, change password |
| **Settings** | `/settings` | Toggle mock/dry-run/headless, configure LinkedIn session cookies, email notifications, API keys |
| **Schedule** | `/schedule` | Cron-style automation — set time, days, pipeline mode, view run history |
| **Admin** | `/admin` | User management, profile management, database reset (admin-password protected) |
| **Setup** | `/onboarding` | Upload resume PDF + LinkedIn URL to generate profiles (first-run wizard) |

**Live progress streaming:** Pipeline and market operations stream real-time progress via Server-Sent Events (SSE) — you see each step as it happens, with keepalive pings during long operations.

---

## Authentication & Multi-User

The web GUI is login-protected. All pages (except login/register) require a valid session.

### Registration & Login

1. **First user** — when no users exist, the registration page is shown automatically. The first registered user is auto-promoted to **admin** and can optionally set the **admin panel password**.
2. **Subsequent users** — can register while `JOBHUNTER_REGISTRATION_ENABLED=true` (default).
3. **Sessions** — JWT-based via `access_token` cookie (7-day expiry). Logging in from another browser/device replaces the session.


### Account Settings

Click your **name in the top navigation bar** to open `/account`, where you can:
- Change your **display name** and **email address**
- **Change your password** (requires current password)
- View account info: user ID, role, status, registration date, last login

### Per-User Settings

Each user can override global settings from the **Settings** page:
- **OpenAI API key** — each user can set their own key
- **Runtime flags** — mock mode, dry-run, headless, slow-mo
- **Email notifications** — provider, credentials, recipient

Settings that are left unset on the user row inherit from the global `AppSettings` (`.env` file).

### Admin Panel

The admin panel (`/admin`) is protected by a standalone **admin password** (not tied to any user account). If no admin password is configured, any logged-in user can access it.

The admin panel provides:
- User management — activate/deactivate, promote/demote admin, delete users
- Database reset — erase all data and start fresh (including admin password)

Set the admin password via `JOBHUNTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`, during first-user registration, or from the admin panel itself.

---

## Scheduling

The built-in scheduler runs pipeline jobs automatically on a cron-like schedule. Configure it from the **Schedule** page in the web GUI or via `data/schedule.yml`.

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Enabled** | off | Toggle the scheduler on/off |
| **Time of day** | `09:00` | When to run (24 h format) |
| **Days of week** | Mon–Fri | Which days to run |
| **Pipeline mode** | `full` | `discover` / `discover_score` / `full` / `market` |
| **Profile** | `default` | Which search profile to use |

### How it works

- The scheduler runs inside the web server process (APScheduler `AsyncIOScheduler`).
- Only one task runs at a time — if a pipeline is already running, the scheduled trigger is skipped.
- After each run, a summary is recorded in `data/schedule_history.yml` (capped at 100 entries).
- If email notifications are enabled, a pipeline summary email is sent after each run.

### `data/schedule.yml` example

```yaml
schedule:
  enabled: true
  time_of_day: '09:00'
  days_of_week: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
  pipeline_mode: full
  profile_name: default
```

---

## Email Notifications

Receive email summaries after each scheduled pipeline run. Two providers are supported:

### Resend (recommended — simple)

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Create an API key
3. In **Settings** → **Email Notifications**, select **Resend**, paste the API key, enter your email

That's it — no SMTP configuration needed.

### SMTP (advanced)

For Gmail, Outlook, or custom mail servers:

| Provider | Host | Port | TLS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gmail** | `smtp.gmail.com` | 587 | ✅ | Requires an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) |
| **Outlook** | `smtp.office365.com` | 587 | ✅ | |
| **Local relay** | `localhost` | 25 | ❌ | Leave credentials blank |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `JOBHUNTER_EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `resend` (default) or `smtp` |
| `JOBHUNTER_RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key |
| `JOBHUNTER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` | Recipient email address |
| `JOBHUNTER_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` | `true` / `false` |
| `JOBHUNTER_SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname |
| `JOBHUNTER_SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port (default: 587) |
| `JOBHUNTER_SMTP_USER` | SMTP username (optional for relays) |
| `JOBHUNTER_SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password |
| `JOBHUNTER_SMTP_USE_TLS` | `true` / `false` |

All settings can also be configured from the **Settings** page in the web GUI. Changes are persisted to `.env` automatically.

---

## Operating Modes

The system has three operating modes controlled by global flags:

| Mode | Flags | LinkedIn | Applications | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mock** | `--mock` | Local HTML fixtures | Never | Development & testing |
| **Dry-run** | `--real --dry-run` | Real LinkedIn | Stops before submit | Preview & verification |
| **Live** | `--real` | Real LinkedIn | Submits for real | Production use |

**Recommended workflow:** Start with `--mock` to verify setup, then `--real --dry-run` to preview real jobs, then `--real` when ready.

┌──────────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌────────┐
│ Discover │───>│ Score │───>│ Queue │───>│ Apply │───>│ Report │
└──────────┘    └───────┘    └───────┘    └───────┘    └────────┘
     │               │                        │

  LinkedIn      Embeddings +           Easy Apply wizard
  search        LLM evaluation         + LLM form filler
  + parsing     + industry prefs       (Playwright)
                + market boost
```

1. **Discover** — searches LinkedIn using your profile keywords, parses HTML results
2. **Score** — computes embedding similarity (0.0–1.0) and LLM fit score (0–100) for each job; applies industry preference boosts; optionally enriches with market opportunity signals
3. **Queue** — marks jobs as `QUEUED` if: `easy_apply=true`, fit ≥ `min_fit_score`, similarity ≥ `min_similarity`
4. **Apply** — automates the Easy Apply wizard via Playwright; LLM generates contextual answers for form questions
5. **Report** — produces daily Markdown + JSON summaries with stats, job tables, and market section

**Job statuses:** `new` → `scored` → `queued` → `applied` / `skipped` / `blocked` / `review` / `failed`

**LLM form filling:** the Easy Apply wizard encounters arbitrary questions (dropdowns, text fields, radio buttons). The system uses GPT to generate contextually appropriate answers based on your user profile.

## Market Intelligence Pipeline

```
┌────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌───────┐
│ Ingest │──>│ Extract │──>│ Graph │──>│ Trends │──>│ Role Model │──>│ Candidate │──>│ Match │
└────────┘   └─────────┘   └───────┘   └────────┘   └────────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────┘

```

1. **Ingest** — converts discovered jobs into market events (idempotent)
2. **Extract** — runs signal extraction on job descriptions: technologies, skills, tools, methodologies, certifications, companies (heuristic keyword matching or OpenAI LLM)
3. **Graph** — normalises entities (fuzzy matching + alias resolution), builds evidence and co-occurrence edges
4. **Trends** — computes per-entity frequency, momentum (rising/falling), novelty, and burst scores
5. **Role Model** — clusters jobs by normalised title, builds role archetypes with entity importance weights; title normalisation via heuristic rules or OpenAI LLM
6. **Candidate Model** — projects your `user_profile.yml` skills into the entity graph with confidence scoring
7. **Match** — compares your capabilities against each role archetype: success score, confidence, learning upside, mismatch risk, hard/soft/learnable gap classification; graph proximity boost

**Outputs:**
- Per-role opportunity scores with gap analysis
- Rising technology trends and skill demand signals
- Market-enhanced scoring on individual job detail pages
- Market Intelligence section in daily reports

```bash
JOBHUNTER_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
JOBHUNTER_EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
JOBHUNTER_RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
JOBHUNTER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

The app reads `.env` on startup. Shell environment variables take precedence.

### Profile Files

## Testing

All tests run **fully offline** — no API keys, internet, or LinkedIn account needed.

```bash
uv run pytest -q                    # Quick summary
uv run pytest -v                    # Verbose output
uv run pytest tests/test_web.py     # Specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_market.py  # Market Intelligence tests
uv run pytest -k "test_upsert"     # Pattern matching
```

**Current:** 377 tests passed.

Tests use fake implementations for all external services:
- `FakeEmbedder` — fixed similarity scores
- `FakeLLMEvaluator` — deterministic fit scores
- `FakeProfileGenerator` — canned profile output
- `FakeMarketExtractor` — deterministic signal extraction
- `FakeTitleNormalizer` — deterministic title cleaning
- `FakeDialogueEvaluator` — deterministic session scores
- `FakeNotifier` — records emails instead of sending

All database tests use in-memory SQLite. Mock discovery tests spin up a local HTTP server with HTML fixtures.

### Windows Development Notes

Primary development is on **Windows (PowerShell)**. Common equivalents:

| Unix | PowerShell |
|---|---|
| `cat file` | `Get-Content file` |
| `head -n 20 file` | `Get-Content file -Head 20` |
| `tail -n 20 file` | `Get-Content file -Tail 20` |
| `tail -f file` | `Get-Content file -Wait -Tail 20` |
| `grep pattern file` | `Select-String -Pattern "pattern" file` |
| `find . -name "*.py"` | `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.py` |
| `export VAR=val` | `$env:VAR = "val"` |
| `cp src dst` | `Copy-Item src dst` |

All `uv`, `pytest`, and `docker compose` commands work identically on Windows. Only `deploy.sh` requires WSL or Docker Desktop.

---

## Docker Deployment

### One-command deploy

The included `deploy.sh` script handles the full lifecycle — stop, prune, pull, build, run:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

> **Windows:** `deploy.sh` is Linux/macOS only. On Windows, use **Docker Desktop** with `docker compose` commands below, or run the script in **WSL**.

This stops any running containers, prunes stale Docker resources, pulls the latest code,
rebuilds the image, and starts the container on **port 80** with the `data/` volume and `.env` config.

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Build and start (works on all platforms including Windows)
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down
```

### Manual build

```bash
docker build -t ai-job-hunter .
docker run -d -p 80:8000 -v ./data:/app/data --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped ai-job-hunter
```

The container:
- Exposes the web GUI (default **port 80** via deploy script, **8000** via compose)
- Mounts `./data` as a volume for persistent storage
- Reads configuration from `.env`
- Runs a health check every 30 s at `/api/health`
- Restarts automatically (`unless-stopped`)

## Safety & Ethics

- **No captcha bypassing.** Challenges pause the bot and mark the job as `BLOCKED`.
- **Rate limiting** — configurable delays, daily application caps.
- **Dry-run mode** — runs everything without submitting applications.
- **No secret logging** — cookies and API keys never appear in logs or reports.
- **Respectful automation** — navigates like a human with realistic delays.
